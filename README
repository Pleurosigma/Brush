Hi! This code was written by me, and you should feel completely free to use it in any other open source projects. Though please don't use any of my code without correct citations or clearly mark any and all changes you make.

Also remember that Brush is meant to be used with Easel.js which is NOT MINE. You can find Easel at http://easeljs.com/
